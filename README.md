# CSS VR 

Thin abstraction on top of VR CSS APIs that let you focus on setting up your scene.

The library provides:

1. Camera, viewport and world origin setup
2. VR Devices detection and fullscreen setup.
3. Mouse camera lookup when so you can create VR content without having a headset.
4. Head orientation tracking if an HMD is available.

How to use it:

No time for reading? Just look at the [example](https://vr-components.github.io/css-vr-boilerplate/examples/index.html)

Steps:

0. Import the [cssvr.js](https://vr-components.github.io/css-vr-boilerplate/dist/cssvr.js) and [cssvr.css](https://vr-components.github.io/css-vr-boilerplate/dist/cssvr.js) files in your site.
1. Create a div element with id "scene"
2. Setup your elements with a class "vr" and use regular 3d transforms to position them in space.
3. It should just work. You should be able to look around with your mouse or headset. If not, please find issues.
